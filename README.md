_SE mobile game Gurimu Note Gold Coin Bots which used on BlueStack only_

I left this game in rubbish bin for a long time already. I cannot ensure this app is still work now. BTW Gurimu Note have cancelled gold coins stage already, so this is useless now.

Well, this can be used in Windows only. If you use Linux/Mac/..., I think there are ways to simulate keyboard and mouse action, then automate those.

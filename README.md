_SE mobile game Gurimu Note Gold Coin Bots which used on BlueStack only_

I left this game in rubbish bin for a long time already. I cannot ensure this app is still work now. BTW Gurimu Note have cancelled gold coins stage already, so this is useless now.

Well, this can be used in Windows only. If you use Linux/Mac/..., I think there are ways to simulate keyboard and mouse action, then automate those.

Last thing, this app is buggy which including memory leakage. I won't fix it. If you think this dirty code is useful, just take it and have a refractoring yourself please.

Don't leave any issue to me on this repo.
